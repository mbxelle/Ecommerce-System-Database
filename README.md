# Ecommerce-System-Database (In Progress)
Relational database project for an e-commerce system focused on clean schema design, normalization, and query performance. Currently in development with **Oracle SQL / SQL Developer** and a **Python-based CRUD UI (planned)**.

**Status:** In progress — **expected completion: Nov 2025**

---

## Tech Stack

- **Languages & Tools:** Oracle SQL, SQL Developer  
- **Planned:** Python (CRUD UI), Git/GitHub for version control

---

## Current Progress

- Designed a **relational schema** with **10 tables** and **50+ relationships**
- Achieved **100% 3NF/BCNF**; reduced redundancy by **~40%**
- Executed and optimized **10+ advanced SQL queries** (multi-joins, nested, aggregations)  
  → **~30%** query efficiency improvement in testing

---

## Skills — Applied vs. In Progress

### Currently Applied
- Relational data modeling (entities, relationships, keys, constraints)
- **Normalization** to 3NF/BCNF and integrity constraints (PK/FK, NOT NULL, CHECK)
- SQL DDL/DML, multi-table joins, nested queries, aggregations
- Query tuning basics (rewrites, selective predicates, avoiding unnecessary work)

### In-Progress Learning & Applying
- **Python-based UI** for CRUD (insert, query, update, delete)
- Migration scripts & seed data workflow
- (Planned) Indexing strategy, views/materialized views, and explain/trace-based tuning
- Implement **Python UI** for streamlined CRUD operations
- Add **indexes/views** to further improve read performance
- Build **test dataset** and benchmark suite for reproducible query timings
- Author **developer docs** (schema ERD, table dictionary, usage examples)

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, I will demonstrate:
- **Relational design excellence:** rigorously normalized schema (3NF/BCNF) with clear keys and constraints  
- **Performance-minded SQL:** effective multi-join/nested queries, measured efficiency gains  
- **Data access tooling:** practical **Python CRUD UI** for non-SQL users  
- **Operational hygiene:** migration scripts, seed data, and versioned SQL in Git/GitHub
